# StandUpApp

Nowadays everyone is talking about Virtual Reality. Everything becomes Virtual. So I have got this idea to introduce a virtual team member to our daily stand up. I hope this will make our stand up more fun and more efficient.

So here is what this demo is about: I will talk to this app via voice recognition, and the app will greet each team member and set a timer for each member's talk time. 
For example, in real life, we might set it to 2 minutes. But today in this demo, I have set it to 10 seconds, so we can move faster.

I will show you 3 different scenarios. 
(Suggests select 3 people) The first one, every one in the team speaks really fast, less than 10 seconds. And with "Next" in the end, to indicate that he has finished. So our virtual team members know he is finished. 
(Suggests select 3 people) Second scenario, every one in the team has a lot to say, each of them speaks more than 10 seconds. And let's see how our virtual team member will react. 
(Suggests select 2 people) Third scenario, one team member speaks fast, less than 10 seconds, but he forgets to say "Next" in the end, so our virtual team member doesn't know he is finished. Let's see what will happen. 
And another team member who hasn't finished, but he pauses. So has he finished? Let's find out! 

So the first senario, virtual team member will respond, thank you first person, next person, plesae. And when it goes to the final person, she will notice and say let's do it. 
The second scenario, virtual team member will calculate time, and respond, thank you, time is up, next person, please. And when it goes to the final person, it will notice and say let's do it. 
The third scenario, either team member who has finished but forgets to say "next", or team member who hasn't finished but pauses, virtual team member will respond, are you finished? Then you can answer "yes" or "no, ...blablabla".

So that's the demo !
